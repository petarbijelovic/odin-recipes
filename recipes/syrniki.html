    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Russian Syrniki (сырники) recipe — fluffy, slightly sweet cheese pancakes made from tvorog (farmer's cheese).</p>
    <p>They're popular for breakfast or dessert.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul class="all-lists unordered-lists">
        <li>400 g (14 oz) tvorog (or substitute with farmer’s cheese or well-drained ricotta)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>3 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol class="all-lists ordered-lists">
        <li>
            Prepare the cheese:
            <p>If your tvorog is very wet, drain it through a cheesecloth or press lightly. Then mash it with a fork or blend it until smooth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix the batter:
            <p>In a large bowl, combine tvorog, egg, sugar, salt, and vanilla. Stir well.</p>
            <p>Add flour gradually until the dough is sticky but shapeable. Don't overdo the flour — too much makes them tough.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape the syrniki:
            <p>Dust your hands and work surface with flour.</p>
            <p>Take a heaping tablespoon of dough and form a small patty (about 1.5-2 cm thick). Lightly coat each side with flour.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
