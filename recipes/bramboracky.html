        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li>4 large potatoes</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons caraway seeds (Optional)</li>
                <li>1 pinch dried marjoram (Optional)</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Peel and coarsely grate potatoes; squeeze out as much liquid as you can.<br>
                    Transfer shredded potatoes to a bowl; stir in garlic, caraway seeds, marjoram, salt, and black pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Beat eggs and milk together; stir into potato mixture until well combined.<br>
                    Gradually stir in flour until a thick but still pourable batter forms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat about ¼-inch oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Drop ¼ cupful batter<br>
                    into skillet, flattening slightly; fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.<br>
                    Drain on paper towels. Taste pancake; adjust seasoning if necessary. Repeat<br>
                    with remaining batter.
                </li>
            </ol>
